# Bradley Woodle's Portfolio website

## The Web Page

This website is a collection of my work, links, and as well as a show of my heart, soul, and passion.

- used HTML and CSS

- The big problem i faced was figuring out how Chrome dev tools was displaying the mobile versions, so instead i put noticable css changes in and resized the window to test the responsivness, then altered my code to display the intended result.
